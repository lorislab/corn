This directory allows you run corn.

ROOT DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
----------------------------------------

The root of this directory is designed to run corn. There are shell and batch scripts (corn and corn.bat)
which will run the corn command line application.

The "lib" directory is automatically scanned by the corn scripts and all .jar files are added to the class-path.
